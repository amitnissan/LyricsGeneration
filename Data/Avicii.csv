Avicii,Wake Me Up," Feeling my way through the darkness Guided by a beating heart I can't tell where the journey will end But I know where to start They tell me I'm too young to understand They say I'm caught up in a dream Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes Well that's fine by me   So wake me up when it's all over When I'm wiser and I'm older All this time I was finding myself And I didn't know﻿ I was lost So wake me up when it's all over When I'm wiser and I'm older All this time I was finding myself And I didn't know ﻿I was lost     I tried carrying the weight of the world But I only have two hands I hope I get the chance to travel the world But I don't have any plans Wish that I could stay forever this young Not afraid to close my eyes Life's a game﻿ made for everyone And love is the prize  So wake me up when it's all over When I'm wiser and I'm older All this time I was finding myself And I didn't know﻿ I was lost So wake me up when it's all over When I'm wiser and I'm older All this time I was finding myself And I didn't know I was lost   I didn't know I was lost I didn't know I was lost I didn't know I was lost I didn't know, I didn't know, I didn't know170Embed"

Avicii,Waiting for Love," Where there's a will, there's a way, kinda beautiful And every night has its day, so magical And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle That can't be defeated For every tyrant a tear for the vulnerable In every lost soul the bones of a miracle For every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable With something to believe in   Monday left me broken Tuesday I was through with hopin' Wednesday my empty arms were open Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love Thank the stars it's Friday I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday I'll be waiting for love Waiting for love to come around     We are one of a kind, irreplaceable How did I get so blind and so cynical? If there's love in this life we're unstoppable No, we can't be defeated  Monday left me broken Tuesday I was through with hopin' Wednesday my empty arms were open Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love Thank the stars it's Friday I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday I'll be waiting for love Waiting for love to come around 101Embed"
Avicii,The Nights,"  Once upon a younger year When all our shadows disappeared The animals inside came out to play  Hey, went face to face with all our fears Learned our lessons through the tears Made memories we knew would never fade   One day my father he told me Son, don't let it slip away He took me in his arms, I heard him say  When you get older Your wild heart will live for younger days Think of me if ever you're afraid   He said, one day you'll leave this world behind So live a life you will remember My father told me when I was just a child These are the nights that never die My father told me           When thunderclouds start pouring down Light a fire they can't put out Carve your name into those shining stars He said, go venture far beyond the shores Don't forsake this life of yours I'll guide you home no matter where you are   One day my father he told me Son, don't let it slip away When I was just a kid, I heard him say When you get older Your wild heart will live for younger days Think of me if ever you're afraid   He said, one day you'll leave this world behind So live a life you will remember My father told me when I was just a child These are the nights that never die My father told me     Oooh, oooh   These are the nights that never die My father told me   Oooh, oooh  Oooh, oooh    Oooh, oooh  My father told me85Embed"

Avicii,Addicted to You," I don't know just how it happened; I let down my guard Swore I'd never fall in love again, but I fell hard Guess I should have seen it coming; caught me by surprise Wasn't looking where I was going; I fell into your arms   You came into my crazy world like a cool and cleansing rain Before I, I knew what hit me, baby, you were flowing through my veins   I'm addicted to you, hooked on your love Like a powerful drug I can't get enough of Lost in your eyes, drowning in blue Out of control, what can I do? I'm addicted to you   Midnight blows in through the window, dances 'round the room Got me hypnotised, I'm getting high on the perfume I couldn't live without you now, oh, I know I'd go insane I wouldn't last one night alone, baby I couldn't stand the pain   I'm addicted to you, hooked on your love Like a powerful drug I can't get enough of Lost in your eyes, drowning in blue Out of control, what can I do?

Avicii,Broken Arrows," You stripped your love down to the wire Fire shy and cold alone outside You stripped it right down to the wire But I see you behind those tired eyes   Now as you wade through shadows that live in your heart You'll find the light that leads home Cause I see you for you and your beautiful scars So take my hand, don't let go   Cause it's not too late, it's not too late I, I see the hope in your heart And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting Broken arrows in the dark But I, I see the hope in your heart   I've seen the darkness in the light The kind of blue that leaves you lost and blind The only thing that's black and white Is that you don't have to walk alone this time   We have to tear down walls that live in your heart To find someone you call home Now you see me for me and my beautiful scars So take my hand, don't let go  Cause it's not too late, it's not too late I, I see the hope in your heart And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting Broken arrows in the dark But I, I see the hope in your heart   It's not too late, it's not too late I see the hope in your heart Sometimes losing, sometimes shooting Broken arrows in the dark12Embed"

Avicii,Liar Liar," Liar, liar! No you don't ever tell the truth Liar, liar!

No you don't ever tell the truth Liar, liar! Can't nobody say you're fireproof    All closed and in your head Counting heartbeats 'till the feeling's good and gone On a dull path in a rush A sad greed pouring rain over everything It will lead us to apocalypse Where the whispers and the sand and the sun eclipse, forever more We need to find a way Find a way Find a way Find a way Find a way   Well, we are, who we are, when we're all going under When the past with the last and will last until we're under   Liar, liar! No you don't ever tell the truth Liar, liar! Can't nobody say you're fireproof     People talking but I can't hear them, no I just sit there and watch them come and go There might be something underneath it all But at least I'll find the love found down the moon But at least I'll find, we'll all find out in the end13Embed"

Avicii,Avicii Announces His Retirement,"Avicii Announces His Retirement LyricsIt would be no surprise that Avicii’s retirement announcement would spark interesting developments across the electronic music sphere, and now we get our first concrete evidence of that.  Viagogo, calling itself the “world’s largest source of live event tickets,” has reported a 151% surge in demand for Avicii tickets. Demand for Creamfields alone surged 87% overnight.  Avicii’s final performances are in locations such as “Ibiza, Japan, Poland, Israel, Sweden and Dubai, as well as a stints at Lisbon’s Rock in Rio, Electric Daisy Carnival UK, Ultra Korea, Weekend Festival Baltic and Creamfields.”  A viagogo spokesperson commented: “Avicii has become a world-renowned DJ, carving himself as a major player in the industry, not just in the UK but across the globe. As a result he has a huge and loyal fanbase who are desperate to see him in what could be his ever last tour.”  It’s not uncommon for retirement announcements to send ticket prices and demand soaring; take the announcement of Kobe Bryant’s retirement into account, when tickets prices for his final game more than tripled after the announcement.  Undoubtedly, fans will be seeing this opportunity as their final chance to see a legend and to say goodbye. Though he will continue music, chances that he returns behind the decks are slim. However, we’ve seen similar claims from Wolfgang Gartner, Feed Me, and Pendulum, and look what happened there.  Truth is, only time will tell. In the meantime, fans will continue to clamor over tickets.Embed"
