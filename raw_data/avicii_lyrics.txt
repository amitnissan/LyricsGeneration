Feeling my way through the darkness 
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start

They tell me I'm too young to understand 
They say I'm caught up in a dream 
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes 
Well that's fine by me

So wake me up when it's all over 
When I'm wiser and I'm older 
All this time I was finding myself 
And I didn't know I was lost

I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans

Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is the prize

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost

Didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know (didn't know, didn't know)


We are one

I don't know just how it happened,
I let down my guard...
Swore I'd never fall in love again
But I fell hard.

Guess I should have seen it coming,
Caught me by surprise...
I wasn't looking where I was going,
I fell into your eyes.

You came into my crazy world like a cool and cleansing wave.
Before I, I knew what hit me baby you were flowing through my veins...

I'm addicted to you,
Hooked on your love,
Like a powerful drug
I can't get enough of,
Lost in your eyes,
Drowning in blue
Out of control,
What can I do?
I'm addicted to you!

Midnight blows in through the window,
Dances round the room...
Got me hypnotized,
I'm getting high on the perfume.

I couldn't live without you now,
Oh, I know I'd go insane,
I wouldn't last one night alone baby,
I couldn't stand the pain!

I'm addicted to you!
Hooked on your love,
Like a powerful drug
I can't get enough of,
Lost in your eyes,
Drowning in blue
Out of control,
What can I do?
I'm addicted to you!


So bold and fine
I’ve known you for some time.
Whole life changed while
Bones like yours and mine

Go dance in the woods
And down we go, down, down
Oh, boy, you’re mine
Do you remember old times?

Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You’re a wild boy, I am a wild girl too
Oh, dear boy, it’s so hollow without you
In a world with everything but it won't do

Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You’re a wild boy, I am a wild girl too
Oh, dear boy, it's so shallow in the blue
It's our time for everything and I call you

Sweet love of mine
Destruction ain't a crime
For those who find
Love is a game like you and I

Go dance in the waters
Of all the tears we have cried
Oh, boy, we're fine
Do you remember our time?

Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You’re a wild boy, I am a wild girl too
Oh dear boy, it’s so hollow without you
In a world with everything but it won't do

Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You’re a wild boy, I am a wild girl too
Oh, dear boy, it's so shallow in the blue
It's our time for everything and I call you


Hey, brother, there's an endless road to re-discover
Hey, sister, know the water's sweet but blood is thicker
Oh, if the sky comes falling down for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

Hey, brother, do you still believe in one another?
Hey, sister, do you still believe in love, I wonder?
Oh, if the sky comes falling down for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

What if I'm far from home?
Oh, brother, I will hear you call
What if I lose it all?
Oh, sister, I will help you out!
Oh, if the sky comes falling down for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

Hey, brother, there's an endless road to re-discover

Liar, liar! Oh you don't ever tell the truth
Liar, liar! Can't nobody see you're fireproof?

Follow you to dust
Leavin' footprints on the clouds as we're walkin' home
Iron hearts all turn to rust
By tears and the daze on a diamond street
Kiss these apocalypse
Chasin' shadows, livin' dreams that don't exist
Anymore

We need to find a way
Find a way
Find a way
Find a way
Find a way

Well, we are, who we are, when we're all goin' under
We're the past, we're the last, and will last until we're under

Liar, liar! Oh you don't ever tell the truth
Liar, liar! Can't nobody see you're fireproof?

All closed and in your head
Counting heartbeats 'til the feeling's good and gone
On a dark path in a rush
Sky clears all the rain over everything
Hear these apocalypse
Where the whispers and the sand and the sun eclipse, forevermore

We need to find a way
Find a way
Find a way
Find a way
Find a way

Well, we are, who we are, when we're all goin' under
We're the past, we're the last, and will last until we're under

Liar, liar! Oh you don't ever tell the truth
Liar, liar! Can't nobody see you're fireproof?

People talkin' but I can't hear them, no!
I just sit there and watch them come and go
There might be something underneath it all
But at least I'll find what I'll find out in the end
At least I'll find what I'll find out in the end


Shame on me for loving you
Can't deny that you been untrue
Lie so sweet but you love to teach
Put the fire out with gasoline

I'm baptized and born again
You go to hell with your fucked up friends
Crazy little bitch in the first degree
Shame on you for loving me.

All my life
(That's what I get for loving you)
Lie! Lie! Lie!

Why? Why? Why?

Imma raise hell for the better man

Shame on you for loving me.

All my life
(That's what I get for loving you)
Lie! Lie! Lie!
(No I can't live without you)
Why? Why? Why?
(And all the things you put me through)

You gotta walk a mile 'til you're outta my head

Come within, taste it up
Take a little bit and baby don't you give up
Get your life, give a damn

Hope there's someone
Who'll take care of me
When I die, will I go?

And hope there's someone
Who'll set my heart free
Rest alone when I'm tired

There's a ghost on the horizon
When I go to bed
How will I fall asleep tonight?
How will I rest my head?

And godsend I don't want to go
To the seal's watershed

And there's a ghost on the horizon
When I go to bed

Oh! Oh! ...

Oh I'm scared of that middle place
Between light and nowhere
I don't want to be the one
Left in there, left in there

And there's a man on the horizon
Wish that I'd go to bed
And if I fall to his feet tonight
Will allow rest my head

And godsend I don't want to go
To the seal's watershed
And there's a ghost on the horizon
When I go to bed...


Yeah! Our story goes
He went down to the crossroads
He sat down and kept his eyes closed
Well, everyone has a price, child
And what it cost him
Was his soul

You think you're getting away
No escape from the deal you made
You walked right into his plan
Run as fast as you think you can
Back from wherever you came
Call the devil by any name
Oh no! Now who do you blame?
Should have listened to what I'd said
What I'd said, what I'd said, yeah!

I don't know if I'll be coming home again, home again
No, I don't know if I'll be coming home
It's a long road to hell without no soul

Just when you think you're getting away
No escape from the deal you made
You walked right into his plan
Run as fast as you think you can
Back from wherever you came
Call the devil by any name
Oh no! Now who do blame?
Should have listened to what I'd said
What I'd said, what I'd said, yeah!
Let me tell you it's a hard road to hell without no soul


Take me from the city
Let's go for a drive
Take me, Take me anywhere
Just make me feel alive
Make me feel this fire
Higher than the sun
Things could be so easy
But we're always on the run

Always on the run
Always on the run
Things could be so easy
But we're always on the run
Always on the run
Always on the run
Things could be so easy
But we're always on the run

Oh-oh! Oh-oh-oh!
On the run, on the run, run, run, run
Oh-oh! Oh-oh-oh!
Things could be so easy but we're always on the run

We could save our money
We could buy a house
Hit back on our patio
Watching fireflies
We could feel this fire
Higher than the sun
Things could be so easy
But we're always on the run

Always on the run
Always on the run
Things could be so easy
But we're always on the run
Always on the run
Always on the run
Things could be so easy
But we're always on the run

Oh-oh! Oh-oh-oh!
On the run, on the run, run, run, run
Oh-oh! Oh-oh-oh!
Things could be so easy but we're always on the run


I was low,
Didn't believe in getting higher
Didn't know,
How easy it is to walk through the fire

Oh You opened the stars in my heart.
You let in the life from the dark.
It's like the first time
I realized that all you need is love.

And I'm feeling, never letting go.
Oh you take me, somewhere off the globe.
Do you feel it, it's like the first time
I realized that All You Need is Love.

Yea I'm feeling, never letting go.
Oh you take me, somewhere off the globe.
Do you feel it, it's like the first time
I realized that All You Need is Love.


Where there's a will, there's a way, kind of beautiful
And every night has its day, so magical
And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
That can't be defeated

For every tyrant a tear for the vulnerable
In every lost soul the bones of a miracle
For every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable
With something to believe in

Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hoping
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
To come around

We are one of a kind irreplaceable
How did I get so blind and so cynical
If there's love in this life we're unstoppable
No, we can't be defeated

Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hoping
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
To come around


Alone, I'm searching for devotion, in the faded melody
My soul is trying to cross an ocean, down on bended knee
Lock up my condense and rhyme, don't know what I'm trying to say
(My heart) all the time was stolen, by bad poetry

Some nights I talk to myself, I said the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep, I said the words I never said when you were with me
Some nights I talk to myself, I said the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep, I said the words I never said when you were with me

I'm gone, the nightmares cut me open, love's insanity
So long words are left unspoken, couldn't set them free
Watch all the language run dry, thoughts go on holiday
(My heart) I'm left with a broken vocabulary

Some nights I talk to myself, I said the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep, I said the words I never said when you were with me
Some nights I talk to myself, I said the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep, I said the words I never said when you were with me

Some nights I talk to myself, I said the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep, I said the words I never said when you were with me


When you feel me up against your bones
Now don't you tell me to leave you alone
Now don't you tell me, now don't you tell me
I wear the crown coz I'm the one
To be anointed by you touch
Oh how you heal me, oh how you heal me

I want you to touch me (use me like you gonna do),
touch me (do me like you're gonna do),
touch me (touch me like you wanna do)
I want you to touch me (use me like you gonna do),
touch me (do me like you're gonna do),
touch me (touch me like you wanna do)

Said you want it, baby (said you want it, baby)
What you gonna do
How you gonna please me
What you gonna do (what you gonna do)
I just want, I want you to
Said you want it, baby
I'm starving here for you, what you gonna feed me
What you wanna do, I want you, I want you

When you feel me up against your bones
Now don't you tell me to leave you alone
Now don't you tell me, now don't you tell me
I wear the crown coz I'm the one
To be anointed by you touch
Oh how you heal me, oh how you heal me

I want you to touch me (use me like you gonna do),
touch me (do me like you're gonna do),
touch me (touch me like you wanna do)
I want you to touch me (use me like you gonna do),
touch me (do me like you're gonna do),
touch me (touch me like you wanna do)

I want you to touch me (use me like you gonna do)
I want you to touch me
I want you to touch me
I want you to touch me
I want you, I want you to touch me
Touch me
I want you to touch me
Touch me


Ten more days under water
And I already know
I’ll be fine
Ten more days til it’s over
Til the darkness goes
And I see the light

I’m torn between fulfilling my wildest dreams
To satisfy the beast inside of me
And a grounded love that raises me high above
The grabbing hands of cowards and of thieves

Ten more days to find my way
Ten more days til I’m awake
Ten more days til I don’t have to fight
I don’t need a future king
There ain’t a prayer that I could sing
Ten more days and I’m gonna make it right

You see my conscience betrayed me
But baby I’m strong enough
To take the tides
The bed, it trembles beneath me
But wherever the road is rough
You know I’ll rise

I’m torn between fulfilling my wildest dreams
To satisfy the beast inside of me
And a grounded love that raises me high above
The grabbing hands of cowards and of thieves

Ten more days to find my way
Ten more days til I’m awake
Ten more days til I don’t have to fight
I don’t need a future king
There ain’t a prayer that I could sing
Ten more days and I’m gonna make it right


Paint on a caution wind
'Neath the bleeding sky
I called your name
There was no one there
And in the cold and snow
I saw your face

And we sang our song for the little thing
Magic call, but the joy you bring
Running it down the line
Wish you could find that love is a fragile thing
Magic call from a pretty thing
Maybe it might be time
For a better day
For a better day
For a better day

Straight, from the path of love
In the road of life
I tumble forward
But I'm going on
I'mma keep it strong
I saw your face

And we sang our song for the little thing
Magic call, but the joy you bring
Running it down the line
Wish you could find that love is a fragile thing
Magic call from a pretty thing
Maybe it might be time
For a better day
For a better day
For a better day
For a better day
For a better day
For a better day

And we sang our song for the little thing
Magic call, but the joy you bring
Running it down the line
Wish you could find that love is a fragile thing
Magic call from a pretty thing
Maybe it might be time
For a better day


You stripped your love down to the wire
Fire shy and cold alone outside
You stripped it right down to the wire
But I see you behind those tired eyes

Now as you wade through the shadows that live in your heart
You'll find the light that leads home (home, home)
Cause I see you for you and your beautiful scars
So take my hand, don't let go

Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
I, I see the hope in your heart
And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting
Broken arrows in the dark
But I, I see the hope in your heart

I've seen the darkness in the light
The kind of blue that leaves you lost and blind
The only thing that's black and white
Is that you don't have to walk alone this time

We have to tear down the walls that live in your heart
To find someone you call home (home, home)
Now you see me for me and my beautiful scars
So take my hand, don't let go

Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
I, I see the hope in your heart
And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting
Broken arrows in the dark
But I, I see the hope in your heart

It's not too late, it's not too late
I see the hope in your heart
Sometimes you're losing, sometimes shooting
Broken arrows in the dark


I wasn't always the brightest, until I learned how to dance
You got me thinking, love will come around but you, never gave me a chance
I might not been the tallest, until I learned how to jump
You got me thinking, love will come around but you, never say I'm the one

If I could make you, make you fall in love with me
If I could make you, make you fall in love
Wish I could make you, make you make you fall in love
Maybe love will come around if you want it enough
Maybe love will come around if you want it enough

Woah-oh-oh, yeah!

Love will come around

Maybe love will come around, for us

I wasn't always the bravest, they say you only live once
So, you got me thinking, I'm so glad I found you
Life's what you make it so here it comes, it goes
If I could make you, make you fall in love with me
If I could make you, make you fall in love
Wish I could make you, make you fall in love
Maybe love will come around if you want it enough
Maybe love will come around if you want it enough

If you're a true believer
If you're a true believer
Love will come around
Lo-lo-love will come around, for us


City lights, take me away
Now it's time, we never ever head down
Don't be scared, I am for real
Hide away and we will never be found

It's alright, we never look back
Birds will sing if we fall
It's alright, with memories inside
Midnight dust on the floor
Watch it turn into gold

And I don't even know what's real
And I don't know what to feel
I'm your truth in disguise,
I'm in love with your lies
'Cause I can't breath, can't settle down
And I don't know what to feel
No, I don't know what to feel

See these lights, we're getting away
Heads won't find us, we're not making a sound
We're not scared, we are for real
Love can't hurt us, now we're sheltered by lies

It's alright, we never look back
Birds will sing if we fall
It's alright, with memories inside
Midnight dust on the floor
Watch it turn into gold

And I don't even know what's real
And I don't know what to feel
I'm your truth in disguise,
I'm in love with your lies
'Cause I can't breath, can't settle down
And I don't know what to feel
No, I don't know what to feel


Working my money 'till I get gold

Cause I can't get no more
Working my money 'till I get gold
Monday, Friday mornin'
Working my money 'till I get gold
Cause I can't get no more

Started out with nothing and I still got most of that
The world ain't give me much, I'm positive that's a fact
Everybody said be cool, you be payin' your dues
Make a long story short, I got nothin' to lose

When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again
When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again
100 percent, yeah, pure grindin'

Working my money 'till I get gold
Monday, Friday mornin'
Working my money 'till I get gold
Cause I can't get no more

Try to make a dollar out of 15 cents
But I ain't understand how the money was spent
My mama told me, "Boy you ain't got no sense
If we put it all together can we pay this rent?"
I've been some places
Places I never should've been
I caught some changes
Changes that made me who I am

When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again
When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again
100 percent, yeah, pure grindin'
When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again

Working my money 'till I get gold
Cause I can't get enough


Try'na set myself up for the win
So people got a dream that so much bigger than the town they're in
So give me love, give me love, give me peace, give me peace of mind
I know that there's an ought to a start and I need a little help with mine

California, don't let me down
Seems so golden, but there's struggle all around
Sunset Jesus came to me
He once was a waiter, now he's a savior, making money on the street

My dreams are made of gold
My heart's been broken and I'm down along the road
But I know, my dreams keep fading till I get old
Breathe for a minute, breathe for a minute, I'll be okay

Staring at the billboard from the bus
Looking at the faces, thinking that could be any one of us
So give me hope, give me hope, give me hope on this lonely ride
'Cause I know one day, I will be the one in the sky

California, don't let me down
Seems so golden, but there's struggle all around
Sunset Jesus came to me
He once was a waiter, now he's a savior, making money on the street

My dreams are made of gold
My heart's been broken and I'm down along the road
But I know, my dreams keep fading till I get old
Breathe for a minute, breathe for a minute

Sunset Jesus

My dreams are made of gold
My heart's been broken and I'm down along the road
But I know, my dreams keep fading till I get old
Breathe for a minute, breathe for a minute, I'll be okay

My dreams are made of gold
My heart's been broken and I'm down along the road
But I know, my dreams keep fading till I get old
Breathe for a minute, breathe for a minute, I'll be okay


Papa, he was gone tryna make a dime
Mama kept us warm when there was no sunshine
I was busy building up a reputation
Did a lot of things out of desperation
Back up on my feet, got the motivation
Now I found my faith and a good vibration

Search for you, lover, creation
When you're feeling down in this place, just replace them
Keep a vision on the one you've been chasing
When the time comes we'll run to the station
We've been laced with the powers of creation
So when the Sun sets, you bet you must face them
Remember when we were running 'cross the nation
We were living for the here and now

You can't catch me
I'll be gone by the time they come
You can't catch me
The war is already won
Even though the children have sold their guns
We must remember the fallen ones
Remember the fallen ones

Raised in the capital of Port-au-Prince
Born with them pillars in them tenements
Papa used to run from the immigration
When we got to the United Station
A teen under pressure, had to blend in
Before the guitar I had a MAC 10

Search for you, lover, creation
When you're feeling down in this place, just replace them
Keep a vision on the one you've been chasing
When the time comes we'll run to the station
We've been laced with the powers of creation
So when the Sun sets, you bet you must face them
Remember when we were running 'cross the nation
We were living for the here and now

You can't catch me
I'll be gone by the time they come
You can't catch me
The war is already won
Even though the children have sold their guns
We must remember the fallen ones
Remember the fallen ones


That's me right there on the corner, listening to Wu in my Walkman
Neon lights hit the water, reflecting the city I'm lost in
That's me right there on the corner, I one day would be leaving
For a dream that I didn't have, that I'd one day would believe in
Strange how the same place I ran from's the same place I think of whenever the chance comes
It's inevitable cause wherever I go

I hear echoes of a thousand screams
As I lay me down to sleep
There's a black hole deep inside of me
Reminding me, that I've lost my backbone
Somewhere in Stockholm
I lost my backbone, somewhere in Stockholm

I'm from a place where we never, openly show our emotions
We drown our sorrows in bottomless bottles and leave them to float in the ocean
I'm from a place where we never, separate people from people
Some generalize, but in general I still believe that we are treated as equals
My father, my mother, my sister, my brother, my friends and my family's there
My hope and my money, my innocence in a sense, almost lost everything here
Right where I was founded, is right where I'll be found dead
These streets are my backbone, until I get back home

I hear echoes of a thousand screams
As I lay me down to sleep
There's a black hole deep inside of me
Reminding me, that I've lost my backbone
Somewhere in Stockholm
I lost my backbone, somewhere in Stockholm

I'm not alone, I am the fire that burns not in the city, but out in the burbs
A river that's dying of thirst, I am a reverend lying in church
A crack in the pattern, a miracle waiting to happen
A promise that never was kept, one of those moments you'll never forget
I am that feeling inside the one we all know but can't really describe
I am the blood spill, but I'm in love still

Somewhere in Stockholm, but I'm not alone
Don't have to get by on my own, I'm finally home
Hemma I Stockholm
Där jag hör hemma

I hear echoes of a thousand screams
As I lay me down to sleep
There's a black hole deep inside of me
Reminding me, that I've lost my backbone
Somewhere in Stockholm
I lost my backbone, somewhere in Stockholm


I've been a beggar and I've been a king
I've been a loner and I've worn the ring
Losing myself just to find me again
I'm a million miles smarter but I ain't learnt a thing

I've been a teacher and a student of hurt
I've kept my word for whatever that's worth
Never been last but I've never been first
No, I may not be the best but I'm far from the worst
No, I may not be the best but I'm far from the worst

Oh I've seen trouble more than any man should bear
But I've seen enough joy, I've had more than my share
And I'm still not done, I'm only halfway there
I'm a million miles ahead of where I'm from,
But there's still another million miles to come

I keep on searching for the city of gold
So I'm gonna follow this yellow brick road
Thinking that maybe it might lead me home
I'm a million miles farther and a long way from home

I know that there's a plan that goes way beyond mine
Got to step back just to see the design
The mind fears the heart, but the heart doesn't mind
No, I may not be perfect but I'm loving this life
No, I may not be perfect but I'm loving this life

Oh, I've seen trouble more than any man should bear
But I've seen enough joy, I've had more than my share
And I'm still not done, I'm only halfway there
I'm a million miles ahead of where I'm from,
But there's still another million miles to come


I'm gonna love ya, like no one could
Make your heart feel the way it should
I'm gonna hold ya, when no one would
Cause I swear you deserve so good

Livin' up in California
Lovin' life but I've been waiting for ya
To twist my dreams and turn my fate
But God I hope it's not too late

I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
I'm gonna love ya, I know I could

I'm gonna love ya, like no one could
Make your heart feel the way it should
I'm gonna hold ya, when no one would
Cause I swear you deserve so good

Sometimes it's hard to have the upper hand
When every dream you've had is turning into sand
You need someone to make your day
But he took your breath and blew it away

I'm gonna love ya, like no one could
Make your heart feel the way it should
I'm gonna hold ya, when no one would
Cause I swear you deserve so good

I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
I'm gonna love ya, I know I could
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
I'm gonna love ya, I know I could

I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
I'm gonna love ya, I know I could
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
I'm gonna love ya, I know I could

I'm gonna love ya like he never could
Cause I know you deserve so good


Hey
Do you remember we said, "Hello"?
And you asked me about my Levi's T-shirt
Said, "You are a friend of mine"
My, oh my
You must have saved me about a thousand times
I wouldn't be the one I am today
If you hadn't been a friend of mine

I ain't misbehaving
I'm just telling you the truth
Take my love for granted
Yeah, I'll give it all to you
Made me count for something
Yeah, I feel it in my heart
God only knows what I've been
If you've haven't been a friend of mine

Hey (hey, hey, hey, hey)
I haven't seen you around since high school (high school)
How you doin', do you still remember me?
Are you still a friend of mine?
(Guess you're still a friend of mine)
(Guess you're still a friend of mine)
Now I see (I see)
Why I get nervous when you look at me
It's like your eye is trying to tell me something
That you're more than just a friend of mine
(That you're more than just a friend of mine, oh my)

I ain't misbehaving
I'm just telling you the truth
Take my love for granted
Yeah, I'll give it all to you
Made me count for something
Yeah, I feel it in my heart
God only knows what I've been
If you've haven't been a friend of mine


It's you and your world and I'm caught in the middle
I caught the edge of a knife and it hurts just a little
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know that I can't be your friend
It's my head or my heart and I'm caught in the middle

My hands are tied, but not tight enough
You're the high that I can't give up
Oh lord, here we go

I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle
You're the poison in the wine
And I know
I can't change you and I
I won't change
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight

Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together

Eyes wide shut and it feels like the first time (ooh)
Before the rush to my blood was too much and we flat-lined (ooh)
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know just how this ends
Now I'm all messed-up and it feels like the first time

I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle
You're the poison in the wine
And I know
I can't change you, and I
I won't change
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight

Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together
Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together

My hands are tied, but not tight enough
You're the high that I can't give up
Oh lord, here we go

I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle
You're the poison in the wine
And I know
I can't change you, and I
I won't change
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight

Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together
Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together
A little less lonely now
A little less lonely now
A little less lonely now

You said that we would always be
Without you I feel lost at sea
Through the darkness you'd hide with me
Like the wind we'd be wild and free

You said you'd follow me anywhere
But your eyes tell me you won't be there

I've gotta learn how to love without you
I've gotta carry my cross without you
Stuck in the middle and I'm just about to
Figure it out without you
And I'm done sitting home without you
Fuck, I'm going out without you
I'm gonna tear this city down without you
I'm goin' Bonnie and Clyde without you

Now I'm running away, my dear
From myself and the truth I fear
My heart is beating I can't see clear
How I'm wishing that you were here

You said you'd follow me anywhere
But your eyes tell me you won't be there

I've gotta learn how to love without you
I've gotta carry my cross without you
Stuck in the middle and I'm just about to
Figure it out without you
And I'm done sitting home without you
Fuck, I'm going out without you
I'm gonna tear this city down without you
I'm goin' Bonnie and Clyde without you


Steady yourself even though you know that you're falling
Maybe you're falling, but you're still alive
Ready yourself, that's quite enough of your bawlin'
'Cause baby, you're bawling, but you'll survive

Losing is only a sign
It's only a sign that you really tried, really tried
Losing is only a sign
It's only a sign that you really tried, really tried

Forever trading places with the same old me
I'm racking up the cases of who I failed to be
Why would I replace the sky?
Why would I recreate that perfect blue?
What would I change it to?
Oh, won't you tell me
What would I change it to?
Oh, won't you tell me
What would I change it to?

You can copy and paste your head on a new body
But that new body's still made of flesh
And cutting corners gets you where you're going
But how you get there is the real test

And losing is only a sign
It's only a sign that you really tried, really tried
And losing is only a sign
It's only a sign that you really tried, really tried

Forever trading places with the same old me
I'm racking up the cases of who I failed to be
Why would I replace the sky?
Why would I recreate that perfect blue?
What would I change it to?
Oh, won't you tell me
What would I change it to?
Oh, won't you tell me
What would I change it to?


I tried my best that I could do
Just to find out I was never yours
I hang on to the words that you said
And I held out when my world was lost

'Cause I can do so
Yeah I can do so
Yeah I can do so much better
I can do so
I can do so
I can do so much better

I tried my best that I could do
Just to find out I was never yours
I hang on to the words that you said
And I held out when my world was lost

Cause I can do so
Yeah, I can do so
Yeah, I can do so much better
I can do so
I can do so
I can do so much better

Cause I can do so
Yeah, I can do so
Yeah, I can do so much better
I can do so
I can do so
I can do so much better


Step out into the dawn
You pray 'til, you pray 'til the lights come on
And then you feel like you've just been born
Yeah, you come to raise me up
When I'm beaten and broken up
And now I'm back in the arms I love

And I think I just died
I think I just died
Yeah, I think I just died
I think I just died
And went to heaven
And went to heaven, yeah

Beaten and bathed in blood
I'm hit by, I'm hit by your love and drug
And now you've come to raise me up
Oh

And I think I just died
I think I just died
Yeah, I think I just died
And went to heaven
And went to heaven
And went to heaven
Oh, and went to heaven

It's such a night, such a beautiful night
It's such a view, such a beautiful sight
I think I just, oh, I think I just died, oh
And went to heaven
And went to heaven
Oh, yeah, yeah

We're gonna be birds and fly
We're gonna set the world alight
We're gonna lose ourselves tonight, oh
We're gonna be birds and fly
We're gonna set the world alight
We're gonna lose ourselves tonight, oh

Heaven (Heaven)
Went to heaven
And went to heaven


Can you hear me, S.O.S.?
Help me put my mind to rest
Two times clean again, I'm actin' low
A pound of weed and a bag of blow

I can feel your love pulling me up from the underground
And I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch picking me up from the underground
And I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers

We could be more than just part-time lovers
We could be more than just part-time lovers

I get robbed of all my sleep
As my thoughts begin to bleed
I'd let go but I don't know how
Yeah, I don't know how, but I need you now

I can feel your love pulling me up from the underground
And I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch picking me up from the underground
And I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers

I can feel your touch picking me up from the underground
And I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers

(We could be) We could be more than just part-time lovers (Part-time lovers)
(Yeah, more than, more than lovers)
We could be more than just part-time lovers

Can you hear me, S.O.S.?
Help me put my mind to rest


Weight is on me
Weight is on you
We scream and we fight like there's nothing to lose
End of the day
Come and take my arm
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms

Weight is on you
Weight is on me
Sometimes I'm not who you want me to be
God knows I try
We stumble and we fall
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms

Give me tough love
And a lesson to learn
Your tough love
Is what I deserve
Sweet tough love
You're my pretty good luck charm
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms

Can you see my emotions
Sinking away in slow motion
Like a break in the ocean
Just getting lost out at sea
Can you see my emotions?
Say can you see my devotion?
Like a break in the ocean
Just getting lost out at sea

I hear what you're saying
I got a bad reputation
And now you got me praying
For a better situation
Feeling like I'm down, down, down low
Feeling like I'm down, down, down low
Guess it's gonna follow me wherever I go
Guess it's gonna follow me, follow me I know
I got a bad reputation

I know that you been talking
You never see me sleepwalking
Drifting out into nothing
Rolling away in my dreams
Can you feel that I'm falling?
Laying awake til the morning
Every word that I'm calling
Just getting lost at sea

I hear what you're saying
I got a bad reputation
And now you got me praying
For a better situation

I swear I'm losing patience
For all of these fuckin' situations
And I swear I never say shit
But this time I'm gonna say it

When the record's on the final song
And the parties will be long, long gone
All the pretenders and the hangers-on
Can go find themselves another one

But it ain't a thing, yeah, but it ain't a thing
But it, but it ain't a thing, yeah
But it, but it ain't a thing
It ain't a thing, baby

Hey, it ain't a thing baby

Crossbows and arrows
The smoke in the shadows
You'll lose your mind
Standing on the battle line
Starting to choke on
Your heart in your throat and it feels just like
You can't remember how to fight

We'll crack before we shatter
We can't fall apart

We don't get to die young
Trouble keeping our head sometimes
We just have to push on
We don't get to give up this life
All the breath in your lungs
Is stronger than the tears in your eyes
It's do or die, we're alive
And while we're here
Hold the line

Hold the line

Don't hold your hands up it's your final stand off
Put your white flag down
Oh don't you surrender now
No hero's story
There's no blaze of glory
But dawn only comes
At the end of the night

We'll crack before we shatter
We can't fall apart

We don't get to die young
Trouble keeping our head sometimes
We just have to push on
We don't get to give up this life
All the breath in your lungs
Is stronger than the tears in your eyes
It's do or die but we're alive
And while we're here
Hold the line

Hold the line

Hold the line
We don't get to die young
We just have to push on
We don't get to die young
Hold the line


I don't want to be seen in this shape I'm in
I don't want you to see how depressed I've been
You were never the high one
Never wanted to die young
I don't want you to see all the scars within

So tell me why (Oh why, oh why)
Why am I such a freak?
You're out outta you mind (Oh my, oh my)
Who the fuck are you to judge me?
And I told you I'd be different
And I told you I was wild
You're stuck in denial
Yeah, I think that maybe you're the freak

I keep thinking about what we could of been
If we hadn't been caught in what should of been
Yeah, oh we used to be dancing, never cared about nothing
I don't know when we got all these scars within

So tell me why (Oh why, oh why)
Why am I such a freak?
You're out outta you mind (Oh my, oh my)
Who the fuck are you to judge me?
And I told you I'd be different
And I told you I was wild

Checking, checking, microphone checking

People try to fill my shoes
But, see ya, see ya, see ya 'round later

Chillin' while I keep on building

Ticking, ticking, time keeps ticking

With my heart upon my sleeve
My head down low, I still feel broken
Down upon my knees
With my head down low and I still feel broken

Where are you? Where are you?
Oh, now that I need you most and
My heart upon my sleeve, broken down, oh, woah

I guess I'm just down on my luck
The beat should get me out of it
I guess I'm just down on my luck
The beat should get me out of it

With my heart upon my sleeve
My head down low, I still feel broken
Down upon my knees
With my head down low and I still feel broken

Where are you? Where are you?
Oh, now that I need you most and
My heart upon my sleeve, broken down, down, down, down

Now I can't go a single day without thinking of the words I'd say
And I can't do a single thing without thinking of you, thinking of you

Now I'm just left with the pieces to put back together (Together)
(Forever)

With my heart upon my sleeve
My head down low, I still feel broken
Down upon my knees
With my head down low and I still feel broken

Where are you? Where are you?
Oh, now that I need you most and
My heart upon my sleeve, broken down, down, down, down


I'm always left out, stranded on the fence
You came along, no ego, no pretense
In a trance we danced and prayed for no tomorrow
We were brash and we were bold, but we were right

She knows how I'm feeling
She banishes all my demons
So easy, like breathing
She bandages all my bleeding
She knows how I love her
We take it down undercover
She gets me
She sees me
I hope that she'll never leave me
I hope that she'll never leave me

I'm always left out, chasing innocence
You came along, you showed me what it meant
In the days we raced, yeah dreaming of tomorrow
We were brash and we were bold but we were right

And I reckon we can take our time
And I reckon we can go a while
And I'll be there at the borderline
'Cause I owe you all the best of me

She knows how I'm feeling
She banishes all my demons
So easy, like breathing
She bandages all my bleeding
She knows how I love her
We take it down undercover
She gets me, she sees me
I hope that she'll never leave me

(Oh-oh-oh-ohh)
I hope that she'll never leave me
(Oh-oh-oh-ohh)
I hope that she'll never leave me

Never leave me
Never leave me
Never leave me
Never leave me
Never leave me
Never leave me

She knows how I'm feeling
She banishes all my demons
So easy, like breathing
She bandages all my bleeding
She knows how I love her
We take it down undercover
She gets me, she sees me
I hope that she'll never leave me


All of the troubled times that we have overcome
All of the trials to find somewhere that we belong
All I know is that with you I'm holding on
'Cause all of the days are
All of the days are on the run

Don't you love it how it all just fades away?
When your clothes don't feel the songs of yesterday
And I can't go back, and I can't go back

Don't you love it how it all
It all just fades away
It all just fades away

All of the tracks we traced we raced to reach the sun
All of the lives to find a place where we belong
All I know is that with you I'm moving on
'Cause all of the days are
All of the days are on the run

And I can't go back, and I can't go back
Don't you love it how it all
It all just fades away
It all just fades away
It all just fades away
It all just fades away

And I can't go back, and I can't go back
Don't you love it how it all
It all just fades away


Feel like I’ve been waiting so long for tonight;
Cause I just can’t get you out of my mind.
Can you feel my heart beating so fast?
Now you’re here—no, there’s no turning back.

Oh, I think I’m falling—can’t hold on no more.
Enough is enough, enough is enough—just gotta let go.
And as my grip unwinds, I feel your hand in mine.
No, I never felt, never felt like this before.

Come on babe, don’t give up on us.
Choose me and I’ll show you love,
Let me show you love,
Let me show you love,
Let me show you love.

If you cry, I’ll be there at your side;
If you lost, I’ll be there shining my light.
Cause every touch lifts me up to the stars,
Cause nothing could ever keep us apart.

Oh, I think I’m falling—can’t hold on no more.
Enough is enough, enough is enough—just gotta let go.
And as my grip unwinds, I feel your hand in mine.
No, I never felt, never felt like this before.

Come on babe, don’t give up on us.
Choose me and I’ll show you love,
Let me show you love,
Let me show you love,
Let me show you love.


Dirt on your shoulders
I swear I remember when it changed
Don't you remember
I swear I can see it

You're there with your one eyes smile again
You'll be alright now
If you just let it go
Let it go

I feel the weight around you breaking your bones
Let me make it better (Whoa)
Settle down and let me carry you home
Let me ease the pressure (Oh)

Pull all the blinds down
Just close both your eyes now
Yeah I'll stay
Turn all the lights out and stay awake
And fight off the demons
'Cause you got a heart that'll never take
Yeah, it's alright now
You gotta let it go
Let it go


Looking up there's always sky
Rest your head, I'll take you high

Nothing to fear but fear itself

And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness

Fade into darkness
And we won't fade into darkness

All my life been blind I've been taught by greed
Oh lord, what's wrong what's wrong with me?
Oh lord, that dollar is all I see

I left my home as a gift to my past
Next to the things I know will never last
I looked for fire but found nothing but ash
Was at my lowest when it hit like a flash

I'm tired of being down on my knees,
With the weight of the world coming down on me,
She says there's always someone better waiting for her,
That I was so lucky to get her,

I'm tired of being down on my knees,
With the weight of the world coming down on me,
She says there's always someone better waiting for her,
I was so lucky that I get her,

Y'know, I, I wanna cry,
I wonder why all the tears are dry,
I just don't dare to show I care,
I got nothin' left to spare,

I wonder why I try,
I wonder why when nothin' pleases a woman,
I wonder why I try,
I wonder why when nothin' pleases a woman,
When nothin' pleases a woman,
There's just no pleasin' a woman,


Your whole life’s been building up to this moment
Your whole life’s been building up to this day
Every dream that moved you
Every scarm improved you
Every voice around you
Tells you to believe

You can take it to the top
And you’re never gonna stop
In it to win it
O oh o o o oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Take it to the top

The stage is yours to show the world what you’re made of
This is where you rise and reach for the sky
Nothing gonna stop you
Here because you saw through
Anything to keep you
From what you believe

You can take it to the top
And you’re never gonna stop
In it to win it
O oh o o o oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Take it to the top


Press play, fast forward
Nonstop, we have a beaten path before us
It was all there, in plain sight
Come on people, we have all seen the signs

So we will never get back to
To the old school
To the old grounds, it's all about the newfound
We are the newborn, the world knew all about us
(We are the future and we're here to stay)

We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back at the faded silhouette
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, look back at the faded silhouette

Straight ahead on the path we have before us
Day by day, soon the change will come
Don't you know we took a big step forward
Just lead the way and we pull the trigger

And we will never get back to
To the old school
To the old grounds, it's all about the newfound
We are the newborn, the world knew all about us
(We are the future and we're here to stay)

We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back at the faded silhouette
We've come a long way since that day (that day...)

We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, at the faded silhouette

We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, look back, at the faded silhouette


I’ve been watching you, I like those little moves you make…
Said I’m feeling you, Tell me are you feeling me too
I’d like to know your name but I'm so scared,
Afraid of what you might say…
But if I don't ever see you again, can’t let you just walk away…

Now you’re approaching me, excuse me can I know your name?
Took the opportunity, and now we’re standing here face to face

It’s amazing that you're so beautiful tell me are you really real
And you say you wanna see me again you have been watchin me too
I’m so excited excited excited excited!


Ain't nobody gonna tell me shit
I'm still wrapped around your fingertip
and all my friends they love to call me whipped
but what they just don't know
Is I've looked in New York City
and I've looked in Boston too
I found a couple that were pretty
but I'm still gonna stay with you

Ain't nobody gonna tell me shit
I'm still wrapped around your fingertip
and all my friends they love to call me whipped
but what they just don't know.
Is I've looked in San Francisco
and I've looked all through LA
I've looked in Dallas, Texas
but something didn't feel the same.
So I looked in every city

I found a couple that were pretty
but I'm still gonna stay with you
Still gonna stay with you


I want you
All of you
Can we break through?
And start anew?

I want your superlove
I wanna be inside your superlove
I need the spirit with the sexual
I wanna be inside your superlove

We both know
The way to go
Let's take a chance
It's our last dance


It feels good, in my heart, in my soul
When you're right here beside me
I don't ever want this day to end
We can watch the waves, have a Coke
and just sit here beside me
I took a little of my heart again

So we can feel
Forever you feel
Together be real
Together and

No one can stop me when I taste the feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down
No one can stop me when I taste the feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down

You make it easier to sing
You make it easier to sing

It feels good as we stand on the shore
And our hearts are jumping
I grab another Coke and let's dive in
Oh, my love, there's a song in my soul
When you are around me
You make it easier to sing

So we can feel
Forever you feel
Together be real
Together and

No one can stop me when I taste the feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down
No one can stop me when I taste the feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down

With every fading sunset
We see the stars align
We make the simple moments
Last for a lifetime

So, we'll feel forever
You and me, together
We can stay forever
And be real together

No one can stop me when I taste the feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down
No one can stop me when I taste the feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down

You make it easier to sing
You make it easier to sing


Under the tree where the grass don't grow
We made a promise to never get old
You had a chance and you took it on me
And I made a promise that I couldn't keep

Heart ache, heart break
All over town
But something flipped like a switch when you came around
And I'm in pieces, pick me up and put me together

These are the days we've been waiting for
On days like these who could ask for more?

Keep them coming 'cause we're not done yet
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we won't forget

These are the days we've been waiting for
Rattle the cage and slam that door

And the world is calling us but not just yet
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we won't forget

Out on the midnight the wild ones howl
The last of the lost boys have thrown in the towel
We used to believe we were stars aligned
You made a wish and I fell out of

Time flew, cut through
All over town
You made me bleed when I look up and you're not around
But I'm in pieces, pick me up and put me together

These are the days we've been waiting for
On days like these who could ask for more?

Keep them coming 'cause we're not done yet
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we won't forget

These are the days we've been waiting for
Neither of us knows what's in store

You just roll your window down and place your bets
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we'll never forget!

And these are the days (these are the days)
And these are the days (these are the days)


Once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
Went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade

One day my father—he told me
"Son, don't let it slip away"
He took me in his arms, I heard him say

"When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid"

He said, "One day you'll leave this world behind
So, live a life you will remember"
My father told me when I was just a child
"These are the nights that never die"
My father told me

"When thunder clouds start pouring down
Light a fire they can't put out
Carve your name into those shining stars"
He said, "Go venture far beyond the shores
Don't forsake this life of yours
I'll guide you home no matter where you are"

One day my father—he told me
"Son, don't let it slip away"
When I was just a kid I heard him say

"When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid"

He said, "One day you'll leave this world behind
So, live a life you will remember"
My father told me when I was just a child
"These are the nights that never die"
My father told me

"These are the nights that never die"
My father told me
My father told me


I'm gonna love ya, like no one could
Make your heart feel the way it should
I'm gonna hold ya, when no one would
'Cause I swear you deserve so good

Livin' up in California
Lovin' life that I've been waiting for the
Push my dreams into my fate
Sometimes I hope it's not too late

I wanna love ya,
I wanna love ya,
I wanna love ya, like no one could

I'm gonna love ya, like no one could
Make your heart feel the way it should
I'm gonna hold ya, when no one would
'Cause I swear you deserve so good

Sometimes it's hard to have the upper hand
When every dream you had is turning into sand
You need someone to make your day
But he took your breath and flew it away

I'm gonna love ya, like no one could
Make your heart feel the way it should
I'm gonna hold ya, when no one would
'Cause I swear you deserve so good

I wanna love ya,
I wanna love ya,
I wanna love ya, like no one could

I wanna love ya,
I wanna love ya,
I wanna love ya, like no one could

I wanna love ya,
I wanna love ya,
I wanna love ya, like no one could

I wanna love ya,
I wanna love ya,
I wanna love ya, like no one could


I’ve been around the world
And I can’t stop hearing this song
I’ve been around the world
And I can’t stop hearing this song
And I love it

Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start

They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost

Life’s not waiting for a storm
It’s about dancing in the rain
And if it rains lemons
Learn how to make lemonade
Morale of a story
No problems, just solutions
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
We have takeoff, Houston
I’m not them boys that they used to
I got 4 million views collected on YouTube
I grew up around Jesus, coke and thick girls
And that inspired me to be a G note speaker
2 thinks guaranteed, definitely actions
They say the devil’s in the details and I won’t ask this
We got the maker
We got a dream, it’s simple
Live it, wake up

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost

Didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know (didn't know, didn't know)


Hearts run right to the end, right to the end, right to the end...

Hearts run right to the end;
People come now you don’t need to be scared,
‘Cause you gonna love, you gonna love again.

Hearts run right to the end;
People come now you don’t need to be scared,
‘Cause you gonna love, you gonna love again.

You’re gonna love, you’re gonna love, you’re gonna love again
You’re gonna love, you’re gonna love, you’re gonna love again

Take a chance on a broken heart ‘cause it’s starting again
We gotta try even if it’s hard, try baby to understand.
To find a rainbow in every storm, you gotta believe.
Don’t ever doubt that you do belong now.
‘Cause it’s starting with you, it’s starting with me.

Hearts run right to the end;
You’re gonna love, you’re gonna love again (love again, love again)
You’re gonna love, you’re gonna love again.

Hearts run right to the end;
People come now you don’t need to be scared,
‘Cause you gonna love, you gonna love again.

You’re gonna love, you’re gonna love, you’re gonna love again
You’re gonna love, you’re gonna love, you’re gonna love again
